## Programming Languages

Simon has deep expertise in:

- **TypeScript** — Primary language for modern web applications and services, used across his personal projects and client-facing prototypes. He uses TypeScript for strongly typed React/Next.js codebases, API route handlers, and data/analytics tooling.
- **JavaScript** — Extensive experience building frontend and full-stack applications in the browser and on Node.js runtimes, including legacy interop, incremental migrations, and modern frameworks.
- **SQL** — Practical experience designing and querying relational schemas for analytics and application backends, particularly with PostgreSQL/Neon in personal and prototype projects.

## Frameworks & Libraries

### Frontend

- **React** — Advanced experience building component-based user interfaces, dashboards, and data-driven views, with a focus on composability and maintainability.
- **Next.js** — Extensive use for full-stack web applications, including static generation, server-side rendering, and edge/serverless functions. Simon uses Next.js for cr0ss.org and other experiments around dashboards, maps, and AI features.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Used to build modern, responsive UI with a utility-first approach, especially in combination with design systems and component libraries.
- **shadcn/ui & Tremor** — Familiar with building on top of these component libraries to create data visualizations, dashboards, and admin-style interfaces.

### Backend / Full-Stack

- **Node.js / Next.js API routes** — Experience building backend APIs, webhooks, and serverless functions as part of full-stack applications.
- **Serverless & Edge Runtimes** — Practical experience designing and deploying edge-rendered and serverless applications, particularly on Vercel.

## Cloud & Infrastructure

- **AWS** — Experience working with teams running multi-account AWS setups, focusing on structure, IAM, network boundaries, observability, and cost management rather than individual services in isolation.
- **Azure** — Experience with multi-subscription Azure environments in enterprise contexts, again with an emphasis on governance, account structures, and developer experience.
- **Vercel** — Deep familiarity with Vercel as a deployment and edge runtime platform for Next.js applications, including preview deployments, edge functions, and performance optimization for commerce use cases.

### Infrastructure as Code

[Tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.]

### Container & Orchestration

[Docker, Kubernetes, etc.]

## Databases

### Relational Databases

- **PostgreSQL / Neon** — Used for application data and analytics in personal projects such as dashboards and experimentation around personal metrics.
- **SQL-based systems in client contexts** — Experience working with relational databases as part of larger e-commerce and enterprise architectures.

### NoSQL Databases

- **Key-value stores (e.g., Vercel KV)** — Used to store lightweight state and analytics for dashboards and personal tooling.
- **Document and search stores in commerce stacks** — Familiarity with the kinds of document and search databases used in composable commerce architectures, especially when integrating search, recommendations, and content.

## Development Tools & Methodologies

### Version Control & CI/CD

- Daily use of **Git** and hosted platforms such as GitHub and GitLab for collaborative development.
- Experience designing development workflows with feature branches, code reviews, and continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines.
- Strong emphasis on fast feedback loops, preview environments, and automated checks to keep changes safe and shippable.

### Development Methodologies

- Extensive experience working in **Agile** environments with Scrum and Kanban-style processes.
- Comfortable operating in multi-team, multi-product setups where alignment and autonomy need to be carefully balanced (including experience with scaled frameworks such as SAFe from a critical, pragmatic perspective).
- Preference for outcome-oriented, lightweight processes over ceremony-heavy frameworks.

### Testing

- Advocates for testing as a way to make change predictable rather than as a quest for perfection or arbitrary coverage targets.
- Supports a pragmatic mix of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, with contract tests where services are coupled.
- Emphasizes tests that reflect real user journeys and critical business flows, especially in commerce and checkout scenarios.

## Specialized Knowledge Areas

### E-commerce & Retail

Simon has deep experience with e-commerce and retail in the DACH region, particularly around:

- Migrating from monolithic commerce platforms to composable, MACH-aligned architectures.
- Designing unified commerce and omnichannel experiences that connect online, store, and marketplace journeys.
- Supporting retail clients during high-traffic events such as Black Week with resilience and scalability patterns.

### Composable Commerce & Architecture

Simon specializes in composable commerce, including:

- Designing reference architectures and patterns for headless commerce, content, search, and personalization.
- Applying patterns such as the Strangler Fig to make migrations incremental and low-risk.
- Evaluating and integrating vendors like commercetools, search providers, CMS/DAM platforms, and edge hosting providers.

### Developer Experience & Platform Engineering

Simon is strongly focused on developer experience and platform engineering:

- Designing “paved roads” that give teams autonomy within clear constraints.
- Structuring cloud accounts, environments, and tooling so that teams can ship quickly and safely.
- Creating questionnaires, frameworks, and playbooks that help organizations assess their readiness for change and align on platform strategy.
