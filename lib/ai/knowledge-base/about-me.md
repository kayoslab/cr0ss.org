## Personal Introduction

Simon Krüger is a technology leader and software architect based in Bavaria, Germany. He works with retailers and digital businesses across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) to design and deliver modern commerce, data, and personalization platforms. His work sits at the intersection of architecture, engineering leadership, and product strategy, with a particular focus on e-commerce and composable architectures.

With over 15 years in software engineering and a decade of experience in online retail, he focuses on bridging the gap between technology and business with clarity, empathy, and long-term impact. He works with prospects and clients to design modern solutions that are not just technically sound, but culturally sustainable, solutions people want to adopt, own and grow with.

His roots are in engineering, but his strength lies in building meaningful relationships and translating complex architecture into human terms. He has worked as a solutions architect and requirements engineer, always with a focus on empowering teams, whether it’s a marketer seeing new opportunities for engagement or an engineer excited by how easily they can ship a change.

He leverages his expertise in e-commerce, cloud, and MACH (microservices, API-first, cloud-native, and headless) solutions to guide and advise clients on their digital transformation journeys. At the same time he believes composable commerce isn’t a silver bullet, it’s a shift that succeeds only when your people are ready to lead the way. Beyond client work, he cares deeply about how digital commerce evolves, particularly the tension between fast retail and the growing need for ethical, personalized, customer-centric experiences.

In his free time Simon is a Scuba diver, Sports climber and particularly enjoys good food and specialty coffee. He loves to travel and explore new cultures to broaden his horizon.

## Educational Background

- 2011-2014, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science for Secure and Mobile Systems at the Hochschule Trier - Trier University of Applied Science
- 2015-2017, Bachelor of Science in Business Economics and Computer Science at the Hochschule Bielefeld

## Journey into Technology

Simon has always been exposed to Computers. With an older brother who is an Computer Scientist as well, who collected vintage PC hardware his earliest exposure was by the age of 6. When at the age of 8 he wrote the first bit of source code he was immediately drawn into a completely new world. For the longest time of his youth he was interested in building complex network infrastructures and setting up Linux systems in his parents home network. He was interested in white-hat hacking and Social Engineering. By the age of 13 he sets up a Honeypot in their network and explores poorly secured networks around him. When he came to the crossroad where he had to decide for his future trade, he chose computer science over the alternative of becoming an physical Architect. Architecture though keeps being a big fascination for him, both in the physical as well as in the technical world.

## Current Focus

Simon’s current focus is on helping retailers and digital businesses move from monolithic platforms to composable, MACH-aligned architectures without losing sight of business reality. He spends a lot of time thinking and writing about how to make modern commerce stacks actually workable for mid-sized retailers, how to introduce AI and personalization in a way that feels human, and how to structure teams and platforms so they can change safely and predictably.

He is also actively exploring how AI changes the work of solution engineers, architects, and technical leaders, and how to integrate AI tooling into discovery, proposals, and day-to-day engineering work without turning it into buzzword theater.

## Interests

Simon is particularly interested in:

- Modern web platforms built with React, Next.js, and edge/serverless runtimes  
- Composable commerce, unified commerce, and retail technology in the DACH market  
- Developer experience, internal platforms, and “paved roads” for product teams  
- Data platforms for personalization, customer 360, and experimentation  
- Remote work, distributed teams, and the culture needed to make them work sustainably  

He tends to approach new technology with a mix of curiosity and pragmatism, looking for the point where it becomes genuinely useful rather than just novel.

## Personal Projects

Simon maintains **cr0ss.org**, a personal website and blog where he writes about architecture, composable commerce, remote work, and his own experiments with data and dashboards. The site also serves as a playground for trying out new frontend and platform ideas such as personal analytics dashboards, live maps, and small AI-powered features.

Beyond pure software, Simon explores hardware and embedded projects, including experiments with Arduino and ESP32-based systems, IMU sensors, and actuators. These side projects allow him to stay close to the “physical” side of computing and to think about systems end-to-end, from sensors and devices up to cloud and frontend.
