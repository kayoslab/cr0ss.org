-- Move activity-specific metrics (distance_km, elevation_gain_m) into the details JSONB field
-- This makes the schema cleaner and allows for workout-specific metrics without cluttering the main table

-- Step 1: Migrate existing data to details JSONB
UPDATE workouts
SET details = COALESCE(details, '{}'::jsonb)
  || jsonb_build_object(
       'distance_km', distance_km,
       'elevation_gain_m', elevation_gain_m
     )
WHERE distance_km IS NOT NULL OR elevation_gain_m IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 2: Drop the now-redundant columns
ALTER TABLE workouts DROP COLUMN distance_km;
ALTER TABLE workouts DROP COLUMN elevation_gain_m;

-- Step 3: Update the legacy runs view to extract from details
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS runs_legacy;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW runs_legacy AS
SELECT
  id,
  date,
  duration_min,
  (details->>'distance_km')::numeric as distance_km,
  (details->>'avg_pace_sec_per_km')::integer as avg_pace_sec_per_km,
  created_at
FROM workouts
WHERE workout_type = 'running'
  AND details ? 'distance_km';

COMMENT ON VIEW runs_legacy IS 'Backward compatibility view for old runs table queries. Use workouts table directly for new code.';

-- Step 4: Add helpful comments about common details schemas
COMMENT ON COLUMN workouts.details IS 'Activity-specific metrics in JSON format. Common schemas by type:
